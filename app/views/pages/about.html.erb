        <h4> The Program Goal and Course Objectives </h4>
        <p>The main goal of the Chinese curriculum is to cultivate students’ competence in using Chinese to conduct appropriate Sino-American intercultural communication. To this end, students need to develop a capacity to express themselves in a culturally coherent manner, and to understand the intentions of people who live in Chinese-speaking communities.
        The objectives of each course will be addressed in the course descriptions of each course and are also stated as what students are to prepare for every class hour and in every language course.</p>
        <h4>Why Chinese</h4>
        <p>Chinese has been regarded as a strategic language in the U.S., because of China’s economical, political, social, and cultural development. Today, China has become the second biggest economy in the world and is one of the U.S.’s largest trading partners. People who speak Chinese have a huge advantage because they can tap into the Chinese market. Most importantly, studying Chinese means studying a culture, a people. China is one of the world’s oldest and richest continuous cultures. It developed independently over 5000 years. Through learning Chinese, students develop an Eastern mindset to complement their Western one. With increasing globalization, many people from western cultures have realized the charm of this Chinese culture and the advantages of having a well-rounded worldview.</p>
